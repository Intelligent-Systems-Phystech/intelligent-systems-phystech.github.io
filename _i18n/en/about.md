### Department of Intelligent Systems
Phystech School of Applied Mathematics and Informatics MIPT

The base department graduates bachelors and masters in the direction 010900 "Applied Mathematics and Physics". Training at the department is conducted in three specializations "Data Mining", "Design and Organization of Systems", "Information Retrieval and Machine Learning". The base organization is the Computing Center of the Federal Research Center “Informatics and Management” of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The base organization is the Computing Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Federal Research Center "Informatics and Control" of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Created by an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences and an outstanding Russian mathematician, an expert in the field of mathematical methods of recognition, forecasting and data mining [Konstantin Vladimirovich Rudakov](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Рудаков,_Константин_Владимирович). The department has been actively developing since 2003 within the framework of the scientific school of the academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences [Yuri Ivanovich Zhuravlev](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Журавлёв,_Юрий_Иванович_(математик)). A significant contribution to the development of the department was made by the professor of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences. [K.V. Vorontsov](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Воронцов,_Константин_Вячеславович) and Ph.D. V.V. Strijov.

### Areas of educational and scientific activities of the department
Machine learning; multivariate statistics; geometric methods of deep learning; selection of models and neural network architectures; ensembles of models and generative neural networks; functional data analysis and analysis of spatio-temporal data.

### Applied Research
Text analysis and thematic modeling, image and video analysis, multivariate time series analysis, biomedical signal analysis, brain-computer interfaces.

### Principles of Scientific Work
Openness of ideas, projects, results at all stages of study and research; continuous assessment of the quality of ideas and results; communication with the scientific community, updating according to the latest achievements.

### Main courses
***Machine Learning*** read by K.V. Vorontsov is the most famous and complete course in Russia, covering fundamental and modern topics of machine learning and data analysis.

***My first scientific article: automation of scientific research*** read by V.V. Strizhov is a course that provides the basics for performing scientific research - from planning to presenting results. Each student chooses a personal project and receives a personal consultant and expert. For three months, the student prepares a scientific article with theory and computational experiment. The results are presented at scientific conferences, articles are submitted to peer-reviewed journals.
