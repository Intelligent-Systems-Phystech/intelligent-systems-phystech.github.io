### Selecting a Signal Decoding Model

It is believed that a machine learning model solves either a regression problem where a scalar is predicted, or a classification problem where a class is predicted. To predict the phase trajectory, three models are required. One for forecasting, one for analyzing the source data, and one for the target variable. A report on how to choose these models using the example of a neural interface.
