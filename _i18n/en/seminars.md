### Prior Distribution of Parameters in Deep Learning Model Selection Problem [In Russian]

**Date:** 24.02.2022

**Speaker**: [Andrey Grabovoy](../../people/grabovoy_av)

The seminar is devoted to deep learning model distillation. We discuss the alignment of the structures of teacher and student models. Bayesian inference is used to optimize student parameters. We give an examples of distillation fully connected and recurrent neural networks as models of a teacher and a student.

###  Dimension Reduction in Signal Decoding Problems [In Russian]

**Date:** 13.12.2021

**Speaker**: [Roman Isachenko](../../people/isachenko_rv)

The seminar is devoted to the problem of reducing the dimension of space when solving the problem of signal decoding. The decoding process consists in restoring the relationship between two heterogeneous datasets. A feature of the problem is the presence of hidden dependencies not only in the source signals, but also in the target ones. We propose dimension reduction methods that allow using dependencies in the source and target spaces.
