### Assigning Students to the Data Mining Major

#### Algorithm of admission:

1. student fills in the [form] (http://bit.ly/1lFrFha)
2. solves one of the following tasks
3. makes an opinion about the work performed by the students of the department
4. on the appointed date, makes a three-minute report on the task and on the topic or work of interest,
5. is waiting for the decision of the dean's office on the distribution to the department.

#### The interview procedure from the point of view of the department teachers:
1.Gathering the whole group of those wishing to enter the department,
2. we listen to a short report of each participant,
  - "solving a test problem",
  - "my goals for admission to the department" on the material of student works of the department,
3. ask questions, look at the questionnaire,
4. We draw up a ranked list of applicants, publish [by the link here] and send it to the dean's office, close the reception.

### Trial tasks

#### Tips for solving problems (these are just tips, not directions)
- A theoretical solution is more important than a practical one.
- Write the theory yourself (do not copy the material from the lectures).
- Visualize problem solving (freehand drawing is preferable to none).
- Put the results of the experiment on slides (do not show pynb).
- When discussing neural networks, keep in mind that for us they are not black boxes, but transparent ones.
- Take these, or past, or your tasks - which is interesting to you.

#### Spring 2021

##### Problem 33
CNN convolutional neural networks: how convolution, cross-correlation and Fourier transform are related? Explain with the example of images.

##### Problem 34
Does the Laplace approximation method follow from the Bernstein-von Mises theorem?
