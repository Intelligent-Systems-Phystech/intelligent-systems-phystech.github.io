#### Tips for solving problems (these are just tips, not directions)
- A theoretical solution is more important than a practical one.
- Write the theory yourself (do not copy the material from the lectures).
- Visualize problem solving (freehand drawing is preferable to none).
- Put the results of the experiment on slides (do not show pynb).
- When discussing neural networks, keep in mind that for us they are not black boxes, but transparent ones.
- Take these, or past, or your tasks - which is interesting to you.
