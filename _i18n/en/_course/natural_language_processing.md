### About
The course covers the main tasks and mathematical methods of natural language processing.

### Syllabus
* Preprocessing, feature extraction and classification.
* Vector representations of words.
* The task of marking sequences (tagging). The Linear-CRF model.
* Recurrent neural network models: GRNN, LSTM.
* Machine translation. The Sequence-to-sequence approach. The mechanism of attention.
* Transformer architecture.
* The task of language modeling.
* Statistical and neural network language models.
* The task of generating a natural language.
* Contextual vector representations of words.
* Transfer learning to NLP.
* The BERT model and its modifications.
* Text classification.
* Topic modeling and its applications.

### Labworks
The course includes four practical tasks and an exam. The deadline for completing each task is 2 weeks. You can get up to 10 points for each task. For each day of delay, a penalty of 1 point is assigned.

### Grading
0.7 * hw points / 5 + 0.3 * exam points.

### Prerequisites
Machine learning, deep learning, Python.
