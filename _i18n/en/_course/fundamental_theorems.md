### About
The goal of the course is to learn how to rigorously formulate machine learning problems and to show the role of the mathematical approach. The skills acquired in this course are the basis for writing Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D works in machine learning and applied mathematics. The course includes discussions of axiomatic systems, theorems and their proofs that are relevant in machine learning. Their influence on practical applications is discussed.
