### About
The course covers the main tasks of teaching by use cases: classification, clustering, regression, dimension reduction. The methods of their solution, both classical and new, created over the past 10-15 years, are being studied. The emphasis is on a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations, relationships, advantages and limitations of the methods under consideration. Theorems are mostly given without proofs.
